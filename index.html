      <h1 class="text-5xl font-bold">About Us</h1>
      <p class="py-6">Angela has over 30 years of experience in training dogs and has studied positive dog training at the Delta Institute of Australia and attained a Cert IV Companion Animal Services and is an accredited Delta dog trainer.
<br>
        Angela has lived in Canberra all her life and pets have always been part of her family. Currently she has three dogs, Bailey Bear, Chloe Bear and Kody Bear. Angela first discovered clicker training methods and positive reinforcement training when Bailey was enrolled in puppy preschool 16 years ago. Angela attended formal obedience classes with Chloe and Bailey and completed advanced levels. Angela’s third dog Kody was the reason she wanted to explore dog training and dog behaviour further. Kody was a rescue. He had been locked in a bedroom 24/7 by his owner and had no proper socialisation.
        <br>       
        When visiting Hospital Wards and Aged Care facilities in Canberra with two of her dogs as a Delta Therapy dog team. Angela was often asked, ‘how did you train your dogs to be so calm?’ This got Angela thinking and then started her journey to become a qualified professional dog trainer. Both of the dogs had received no formal training other than basic good manners and good socialisation.
        <br>       
        She has also received accreditation as a Fear Free Dog Trainer.
        <br>        
        She is always looking at ways to improve her knowledge and attends Conferences for National Dog Trainers and other dog/training related conferences and is currently ongoing studies in TTouch and Bowen Therapies to broaden her skills.
        <br>        
        Her mission is to help dog owners unleash their dog’s full ‘pawtential’ and teach their dogs to be good citizens in the community!</p>
